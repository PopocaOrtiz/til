# Data Structures & Algorithms by Goodrich, Tamasia & Goldwasser
- part of the curriculum of computer science engineering degrees
- design, analysis and implementation of algorithms
- beginning level data structures
- intermediate level introduction to algorithms
- ADT: abstract data type, list, bag, collection...
- ADT rather than collection of bytes and addresses
- differente implementation strategies for a particular ADT
- object oriented design patterns to organize those implementations into reusable components
- DS: data structure
- algorithm strategies for efficient realizations of common DS
- algorithm performance, common trade offs between competing strategies
- use existing DS and algorithms found in libraries
- many example aplications
    - file systems
    - matching tags in structured formats(HTML)
    - simple cryptography
    - text frequency analysis
    - automated geometric layout
    - Huffman coding
    - DNA sequence alignment
    - search engine indexing
- differences with other books of those authors
    - code redesigned to use python features like generators
    - ADT consistent interface with python's data types and python's collections module
    - dynamic matrix fundamentals for lists, tuples and str
- online help
    - hints to all excersises
    - solutions to excersises
- contents and organization
    - fundational techniques like algorithm analysis and recursion
    - memory management
    - seven most important functions for algorithm analysis, sections that don't use those functions are optional and indicated with a star (â‹†)
